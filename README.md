## L&N Airline Analysis: Low-Cost vs. Non-Low-Cost Carriers
_This Power BI project compares low-cost and traditional airlines using metrics like EBIT, fleet age, and passenger yield. It provides visual insights and recommendations to improve airline profitability and efficiency_

## Project Overview
  This project focuses on analyzing and comparing low-cost and non-low-cost (traditional) airlines using key business metrics. The objective is to evaluate performance, efficiency, and profitability between the two types of carriers.
Using a structured dataset, I performed data cleaning in Excel, applied SQL for metric calculation and grouping, and built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights.
+ Key metrics analyzed include:
+ EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)
+ Load Factor
+ Number of Routes
+ Passenger Yield
+ Average Fleet Age
The final dashboard enables interactive exploration and clear comparisons between airline categories, aiding in performance evaluation and decision-making.

## Importance of the Project
+ Business Insight: Helps airline stakeholders understand where low-cost and traditional carriers differ operationally and financially.

+ Decision Support: Offers actionable recommendations to optimize profitability, such as fleet investment, pricing strategy, and route planning.

+ Skill Application: Demonstrates practical application of data cleaning, SQL querying, and Power BI visualization in a real-world business scenario.

+ Strategic Planning: Provides valuable benchmarks for airlines aiming to improve efficiency or enter new market segments.

+ Industry Relevance: Addresses a timely topic in aviation where low-cost models are growing, yet face profitability challenges.

## Tool Used:
#### Microsoft Excel
Used for initial data cleaning, handling missing values, verifying data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
#### SQL (Structured Query Language)
Applied for filtering, grouping, and aggregating key metrics to compare low-cost vs. non-low-cost carriers.
#### Power BI
Designed a dynamic dashboard to visualize:
Average EBIT, Load Factor, and Passenger Yield
Fleet Age comparison
Slicers for interactive filtering by region and carrier type
KPI cards to highlight high-level insights

## Business Question Answered
What operational and financial differences exist between low-cost and traditional airlines based on key performance metrics?
Specifically, the project seeks to answer:
1. How does average EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) differ between low-cost and non-low-cost carriers?

2. Do low-cost airlines operate with newer or older aircraft fleets?

3. How does the passenger yield compare across both airline categories?
    The goal is to uncover performance trends that can guide strategic decisions for airline operators and industry analysts.
